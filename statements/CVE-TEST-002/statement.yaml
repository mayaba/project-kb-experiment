  text: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. commons-collections:commons-collections is a library which contains types that extend and augment the Java Collections Framework. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. Versions of commons-collections prior to 3.2.2 do not prevent deserialization of the class org.apache.commons.collections.functors.InvokerTransformer. This could be leveraged by an attacker as a gadget within a vulnerable application which deserializes user input to execute arbitrary code.
